      This tool is not an application. Instead, it suggests how to apply for financial support at different state and federal agencies.

      This tool cannot guarantee you will be eligible for support, and does not reserve funding or a place in line. If you choose to apply for support, the agency that awards it will decide whether you qualify.

      Next, we'll ask you how many W-2 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees your organization has. Here's how to calculate that number:

      - Each full-time W-2 employee is 1 FTE. Only include yourself in this number if you are a W-2 employee of the company.

      - For each part-time W-2 employee, estimate the number of hours they work per week, and divide that number by 35.

      - You should leave out 1099 employees.

      If you have part-time employees, this number might be a decimal like 10.5 or 4.32.
